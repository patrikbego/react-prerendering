# DO NOT ADD SECRETS TO THIS FILE. This is a good place for defaults.
# If you want to add secrets use `.env.production.local` instead.

# THIS IS USED IN DOCKER ENVIRONMENT (better name for this file would be .env.docker)

# production: When your application is built with next build
# development: When your application is ran with next dev
# test: When your application is being tested (e.g. jest)
